# Development paused
<p>The development on this project has been paused.</p>
<p>I cannot say that I won't return to the project later in my life, but definitely not at the moment.</p>
<p>The reason for why I have paused the development on this project is that I'm basically making a program to play the game for me, just so I can do nothing for days and then actually play the game for a few minutes or hours. 
</p>This is also why I'm for now quitting Bee Swarm Simulator, as ultimately the game feels pointless to me, and it seems ridiculous that it's basically required to have a macro to play the game because of all the disadvantages that come with not being online 24/7. </p>
<p>For now, I will be returning to Hypixel Skyblock and working on [shaweelAddons-v2](https://github.com/shaweel/shaweelAddons-v2).</p>
<p>If there is anyone, who feels like the idea of this project is interesting—embedding Xorg RDP inside the application to attempt a seamless experience—feel free to fork this project and continue development on your own. If anything I encourage doing so, since in my opinion, anything that will make Linux more accessible to anyone, is a good thing, no matter how small, including finishing such Linux-centric Bee Swarm Simulator macro, as I know that there are definitely at least a few people, that are on Windows for that reason alone.</p>
<p>I don't know if I'll ever return to this project. Have a nice day.</p>
